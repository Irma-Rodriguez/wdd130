        <p>Helo! My name is Irma Valeria Natalia RodrÃ­guez CÃ¡rdenas. I am from Santander, Colombia. I enjoy learning
            new things, which is why I have many hobbies, such as painting, drawing, crocheting, watching movies,
            listening to music, etc. I am currently studying web and Computer programming at BYU-pathway. I am really
            happy to learn new things and to create through programming and designing web pages. Additionally, I am
            excited to continue growing and discovering new skills on this journey.</p>

        <p>Colombia is a beautiful and biodiverse country, known for its variety of climates and stunning landscapes. In
            this picture, you can see CaÃ±o Cristales, also called the River of Seven Colors. Itâ€™s located in the
            SerranÃ­a de
            la Macarena and is famous for its vibrant colors, caused by a unique aquatic plant. This natural wonder is
            just one
            example of the many breathtaking places you can find in Colombia.</p>
